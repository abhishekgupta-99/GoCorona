The world is in the middle of a crisis. Everone is worried and confused about the coronavirus outbreak. The digital space is filled with false alarms, fake news and hoax's. This is where Go Corona app comes in. It provides a smart and innovative solution of delivery of crucial information to the people.  

The **Go Corona** is a mobile app developed by Tachyon TechLabs to provide people with upto date information about the corona virus pandemic in our country. The app provides update information about the number of corona virus patients in the country and state level. It also provides notification and warnings about corona virus hotspots.  

### Idea Description
<ul>
	<li>As the lockdown becomes more strict the movement of the people will be restricted to great extend to stop the infection chain.
</li>
	<li>As a result then it will be necessary that the basic requirement of the people should be fulfilled in such a way that the they don't need to step out of their home.
.</li>
	<li>But there will be scenarios where people need to step outside  for basic amenities  such as Food stock ,medical emergencies, volunteers in providing a helping hand to NGOs and Donation Drives.
</li>
	<li>In these situations, we propose a system that will solve these kind of problems .
</li>
	<li>To get this into enforcement the person in need will use the app with his authentic  login credentials , fill the form ,get a QR code with his encrypted data which will then be sent to the respective authority for a verified digital signature.
</li>
	<li>And the personnel who will maintain the lockdown , when encountered on the paths will scan this QR code and approve his movement  and if the person is not found with the  Qr code will face legal action.
</li>
	
	
</ul>
